cxxproject
----------

cxxproject is a utility library that enables to specify c++ projects easily.

the base of each cxxproject are a set of projects (each project is described
by a small project.rb file which specifies which sources are to compile,
whichs includes to add, which defines to use, ...)

a typically rakefile that uses this system simply collects all project.rb
files and feeds them into the CxxProject2Rake-helper.

TODO:
- get rid of the static compiler (should be a parameter to CxxProject2Rake)
- binary libs loesen (nochmal drueberschauen)
