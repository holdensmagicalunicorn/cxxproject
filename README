cxxproject
----------
cxxproject is a utility library that enables to specify c++ projects easily.

the base of each cxxproject are a set of projects (each project is described
by a small project.rb file which specifies which sources are to compile,
whichs includes to add, which defines to use, ...)

a typically rakefile that uses this system simply collects all project.rb
files and feeds them into the CxxProject2Rake-helper.

examples
--------
see the examples directory for some examples of the cxxproject.
* basic - shows you the basic usage of sourcelibraries, executables and dependencies
* three_tests - shows you an "real life" example of two test-suites that are linked together to three executable (suite1-exe, suite2-exe and suite1+suite2-exe)

hacking
-------
there are three kinds of tests:
 - spec files
 - roodi
 - the exa,ples should work with rake clean all

prerequisites
-------------
gems: rspec, roodi, facets
libs: cppunit

installation
------------
- rake install should install the freshly built gem (if you need sudo, please
  install the package by hand via rake package; sudo gem install pkg/...)
- cd examples; rake (should compile all examples and let the executables
  run)

todo
----
+ introduce CxxProject-module as namesspace
+ do some rdoc
+ factor out linux specific code (os-specific code)
