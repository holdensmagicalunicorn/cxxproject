cxxproject
----------

cxxproject is a utility library that enables to specify c++ projects easily.

the base of each cxxproject are a set of projects (each project is described
by a small project.rb file which specifies which sources are to compile,
whichs includes to add, which defines to use, ...)

a typically rakefile that uses this system simply collects all project.rb
files and feeds them into the CxxProject2Rake-helper.

EXAMPLES
--------
see the examples directory for some examples of the cxxproject.
* basic - shows you the basic usage of sourcelibraries, executables and dependencies
* three_tests - shows you an "real life" example of two test-suites that are linked together to three executable (suite1-exe, suite2-exe and suite1+suite2-exe)


TODO
----
- get rid of the static compiler (should be a parameter to CxxProject2Rake)
- binary libs loesen (nochmal drueberschauen)
